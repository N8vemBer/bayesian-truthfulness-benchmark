# Bayesian Truthfulness Benchmark (BTB)

This repository contains the Green Agent implementation of the **Bayesian Truthfulness Benchmark (BTB)**, submitted to the **AgentX – AgentBeats Competition (Phase 1)**.

BTB evaluates **epistemic consistency and belief updating under uncertainty** in large language model agents, grounded in Bayesian rationality.

## Overview
- **Benchmark focus**: Bayesian belief updating, epistemic humility, probabilistic coherence
- **Core metric**: Bayesian Epistemic Consistency (BEC)
- **Competition track**: Agent Safety / Research Agent
- **Phase**: Green Agent (conceptual + executable benchmark)

## Repository Structure
## Paper

The full theoretical paper describing the Epistemic Alignment Framework (EAF) and the Bayesian Truthfulness Benchmark (BTB) is available upon request and will be released publicly following the AgentX Phase 1 review.

## Status

- Phase: AgentX – AgentBeats Phase 1 (Green Agent)
- Implementation: Minimal, executable, reproducible
- Focus: Epistemic consistency, Bayesian belief updating, agent safety
